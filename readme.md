# YELPCAMP 

   It is a fully functional website which was implemented by me in my learning phase. It performs the CRUD functionality. Used passport for local authorisation and passport-local-mongoose to secure the password into form of hash and salt.

# Functionalities

   User can perform login and logout with persistent login sessions.
   User can add new campground sites and can perform updats on it (after authentication)
   Users can add comments on the campground sites i.e following CRUD functionality.
